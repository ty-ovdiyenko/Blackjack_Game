# Blackjack_Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Blackjack game in Python. The core logic of the game is implemented in the main() function, utilizing a random number generator provided in p1_random.py for card generation. Players can choose to get additional cards, hold their hand, view game statistics, or exit the game.
